Many thanks to the following persons:

- Philippe Brochard (hocwp@free.fr) 
For developing xbindkeys, a tool that I love and which inspired me to create JXGrabKey. Also helped to look at when searching for non obvious solutions.

- gmatt
For his tutorial on XGrabKey and JNI, which also was a factor in inspiration to create JXGrabKey.
See: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=864566

- The escher project (escher.sourceforge.net)
For providing X11 keysym definitions for Java. This saved me lots of work.

- Tran Nam Quang (qforce@users.sourceforge.net)
For being the first one who adopted JXGrabKey in his project (DocFetcher), thus finding out about bugs and helping to resolve them.

- skafoelix (skafoelix@users.sourceforge.net)
For pointing out the bug with numlock and finding a resolution quite quickly.
